                '1. Prepare the espresso coffee or moka coffee, then sweeten it to taste (I prefer it unsweetened) and let it cool in a small wide bowl., 2. Carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks, remembering that for well-beaten egg whites, there should be no trace of the yolk., 3. In a large bowl, whip the egg yolks with a mixer, adding only half the sugar, until light and smooth., 4. With the mixer still running, add the mascarpone cheese, little by little., 5. Clean the mixer attachments well and whisk the egg whites in another bowl, gradually adding the remaining sugar. Whip them until stiff., 6. Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour them into the bowl of mascarpone cream. Mix gently with a spatula, from bottom to top, 7. Continue adding the rest of the egg whites, gradually stirring gently from bottom to top. Mascarpone cream is ready., 8. Add a generous spoonful of mascarpone cream onto the bottom of a glass or ceramic baking dish or casserole, measuring approximately 30 x 20 x 5 cm. Spread it evenly., 9. Dip the ladyfingers for 1 or 2 seconds on each side into the coffee. Let them rest for 5 minutes, then arrange them in the casserole, on top of the mascarpone cream., 10. Add a layer of mascarpone cream, using half of the remaining cream., 11. Add another layer of ladyfingers, then spread the mascarpone cream generously., 12. Using a toothpick, create patterns on the surface of the tiramisu. I like to make small waves, 13. Sprinkle with unsweetened cocoa powder., 14. Cover the tiramisu and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Your Tiramisu is ready to serve.',

                '8 ounces dried pasta half a box, I used penne, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 pound chicken breasts about 3, cut into ¾ – 1 inch pieces, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon butter, 3 cloves garlic minced, ¾ cup (180ml) heavy cream, ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan, ½ cup basil pesto',
                '1. In a medium-sized saucepan, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta., 2. In a skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil and add chicken. Season with salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Cook the chicken until browned and cooked through. You can use a kitchen thermometer to be sure that it has an internal temperature of 165°F/74°C., 3. Deglaze the skillet with a couple tablespoons of water (or pasta water), just to get the fond (brown bits), and scrape off with a wooden spoon. Then melt butter and saute garlic for 30 seconds., 4. Add cream, whisk, then add parmesan and basil pesto. Whisk and cook the sauce for 30 seconds – 1 minute or until the parmesan cheese has melted and the sauce is warmed up. Avoid overcooking, as that can make the pesto turn yellow. Add pasta water to thin the sauce if needed., 5. Add the cooked pasta and chicken to the sauce, and gently mix everything together until combined.',
